# file-system-implementation-using-C-

performed a virtual file system to show the various functions like traversing through a file system, adding new files, deleting files, modifying file position, and more.

Done using vectors, trees, queues and stack data structures in C++.

NOTE: To perform complete functionality i have only introduced the main directories like (root, download, documents, desktop, pictures etc). I haven't added actually files so you 
      cannot perform read and write file. the sole purpose of this code is to show the implementation and using of complex data structures together.
